device_client.py is a MicroPython device protocol client implementation designed to run on a Raspberry Pi Pico W. See the test folder for an example of it being used. The other folders contain examples for controlling specific components attached to the device.

The first thing the client does is connect to the WIFI. To do this it needs the network name and credentials, which must be stored on the device. write_wifi.py must be run on the Pico first to write this information.
